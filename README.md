# Machine Learning and Networking
In this project, I will create a network topology consisting of three hosts and one switch in Mininet, as follows:

All links in the network will have a bandwidth of 1 Mbps and a propagation delay of 50 ms.

## Objective 
The objective of this project is to generate a network trace dataset and apply machine learning algorithms to perform protocol classification. Through this project I will learn how machine learning and data science can be leveraged and applied to networking problems, and I will be introduced to basic machine learning workflows including data acquisition, pre-processing, model building, and evaluation.
